# CSE 437s Week 2: Build a To-Do App
A very simple To-Do app built in HTML and JS. It allows users to add new tasks to page, and when submit is hit, it gives a summary of the tasks the user has made. There is also a button to redirect back to the main To-Do List page. 
> I had plans to regenerate the tasks' checkboxes after hitting submit, but ran out of time. However, if you observe the console, and click the "Add Another Checkbox" button, you can see a JSON print previous text box values.
